##  How to run?

```
# Set mysql database 
mysql -u root -p
create user 'cfbd'@'localhost' identified by '1234';
grant all privileges on *.* to 'cfbd'@'localhost';
create database if not exists user_db;
# Initially tables and data will be created automatically by Java Persistence API
# Update and new operation can be happened from UI
```

```
# Run Eureka naming server to register your services  
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run
# Go to http://localhost:8761
# Check "Instances currently registered with Eureka"
# nothing will be shown because you didn't start any services
# Its Eureka dashboard, where we can inspecting the registered instances later. 
# In the microservices world, Service Registry and Discovery play role since we most likely run 
# multiple instances of services and we need a mechanism to call other services without hardcoding their hostnames 
# or port numbers. In Cloud environments service instances may come up and go down anytime.
# So we need some automatic service registration and discovery mechanism. 
# Spring Cloud provides Service Registry and Discovery features, as usual, with multiple options.
```

```
# Build and run user authentication services  
mvn spring-boot:run
# It will start on http://localhost:8777//api/auth
# for signup -> http://localhost:8777/api/auth/signup
# refresh Eureka (http://localhost:8761)
# Check again "Instances currently registered with Eureka"
# you will see user-authentication is UP
# if you stop this services then it will be DOWN

# When Eureka server didnâ€™t get received any notification from a service. 
# Then the service will be unregistered from the Eureka server automatically.
```

```
# Run Contact service
cd contact-service
mvn spring-boot:run
# It will start on http://localhost:8555/
# and insert 2 dummy contacts info in contact table with name, contact number and address
# Get all Contacts -> http://localhost:8555/contacts/all
# Search by name -> http://localhost:8555/contacts/name/hnjaman
# here hnjaman is the name you searching 
# it will send all contacts containing "hnjaman"
```

```
# Run sms service
cd sms-service
mvn spring-boot:run
# It will start on http://localhost:8999/sms
# To check message for "hnjaman" -> http://localhost:8999/contacts/name/hnjaman/sms
# it will get name and contact number from contact service and generate a custom message for "hnjaman"
# Refresh and check Eureka
```

```
# All service are started use them on Angular UI
# Run Angular User interface
cd microservice-ui
# install node package manager (just for first time)
npm install
ng s --open
# It will open automatically in http://localhost:4200/home
```
